Project to develop: 
-------------

Sport application with data register (Google Fit style oriented).

Aims: 
-------------
The aim of the application is to provide a support when the user wants to do exercise. We can get this aim by saving data like workout duration, distance walked or run (depending on the type of exercise), calories burned (approximately) and subsequently store them in a data history that will allow us to compare, analyze and improve user’s sport performance.

Basic Functionality: 
-------------

>- **User Interface.**
<br>

>- **Positioning System:** through the use of GPS, get the position of people every X seconds. This will allow calculating approximately, but quite rightly, the distance travelled by the user, supporting to estimate calories and other values.  (This system is oriented to different activities like running, biking, walking…).
<br>
>- **Timer System:** to estimate the time spent in each workout session, it will be necessary to implement a timer system that gather the time of each realized activity, as well an internal chronometer. 
<br>

>- **User Management and Data Storage System:** this part consists of creating a database that store workout information (training hours, distance…) and personal information (gender, age, height, weight…) required. This sessions and exercises data history will be able to analyze through stats and graphics.
<br>

>- **Estimate Calories System:** little function to get the number of calories that a person should consume depending of his features and his physical activity level.  This function will allow showing diets or common recommendations to provide a reference about nutrition for the user.
<br>

Optional Functionality: 
-------------

In addition to features referred above, the application could include the following functions, according to time remaining and our abilities.

>- **New Sports:** in a simple way, add other activities (football, basketball…) into the database.
<br>

>- **Athletes Nearby:** this function will position people that are performing an exercise in a near distance ratio. To make it works, other users should activate the app and indicate that they are making an exercise.
<br>

>- **Exercise programs:** it could raise an automated workout system within the app that indicates which exercise the user should perform (using images and alert sounds), period of the exercise, time to rest…All this exercises should be able to do at home.
<br>

>- **Chat/Forum:** the app may include a chat or a forum where users could communicate, to organize training groups or question doubts about exercises.
